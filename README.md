# WELCOME TO EATME PROJECT


## 1. About the idea

EatMe is the idea of 3 IT students, who had to create an API REST in their cursus. What about a dating website around food ? What about meeting people with all the plates you like or cook ?

#### Developped by :
* Raphael Lepiller
* Clement Gaal
* Alexis Renard
